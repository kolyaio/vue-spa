Vue-SPA
====

This is a project based on the tutorial on pluralsight [called Single Page Applications with Vue.js](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vue-js-single-page-applications) by Bill Stavroulaki.

I was learnning to create SPA with Vue.js. This is the final result of my work in parallel to watching this course.  I think it was very good course and I reccomend it to everyone who interested in learnning Vue.

Currently I deployed the Results to Azure [Vue SPA](http://vuespa.azurewebsites.net/)
